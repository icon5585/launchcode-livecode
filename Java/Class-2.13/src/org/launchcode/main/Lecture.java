		// Great YouTube video explaining the 4 pillars of OOP

		// Inheritance and Polymorphism

		// Define difference between Class and Instance

		// Class
		// This is the model or standard about the capability of what an object can do

		// Instance
		// An actual implementation of the class, consider the class the blueprint and
		// the instance the result (object)

		// There are 4 pillars of object oriented programming

		// Encapsulation (Data Hiding)
		// Combining the data with the methods for working on that data. Encapsulation
		// is accomplished when each instance of a class maintains a private state. Instead of being able to
		// modify this state, in the form of private variables/properties, they can only be access and manipulated
		// (setters/getters) via public functions available to users.

		// Abstraction (Implementation Hiding)
		// The process of reducing the object to its essence so that only the necessary
		// data is exposed to the users. Through the use of interfaces, you can abstract out
		// the implementation completely.
		// Note: Both abstract classes and interfaces are used for abstraction!

		// Inheritance
		// The ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object.
		// You can reuse the variables/properties and methods of the existing class 
		// by inheriting it (extending). This enforces the DRY (don't repeat yourself)
		// principle and reduces code duplication.

		// Polymorphism
		// Allows us to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion
		// with mixing types.
		// E.g. If we have a parent class of Animal, with child classes of Cat and Dog,
		// we can store all of these in a single collection (list) of Animals and call methods that
		// are present in Animal that must be implemented in Cat and Dog!
		// See Animal.java, Cat.java, and Dog.java
		showOffPolymorphism();

		// Interfaces vs abstract classes

		// Interfaces
		// Provide the contract for all classes that implement it. In other words, if
		// your class implements an interface
		// it is required to implement all of the methods defined in that interface.
		// This allows for easy swapping of implementations.
		// See Saveable.java, FlatFileSaver.java, and DatabaseSaver.java
		showOffInterfaces();

		// Abstract classes
		// An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can
		// be concrete methods (implementations) where the method signature and body are
		// provided. Abstract classes can also have constructors (which are called by child
		// classes), that interfaces cannot have.
		// See Animal.java

		// When to use an abstract class Vs. interface
		// If there isn't much (or any) common code among all the child classes, use an
		// interface, otherwise use an abstract class to reduce code duplication.
		// When application functionalities have to be defined as a contract, but not
		// concerned about who implements the behavior.
		// i.e., third-party vendors need to implement it fully

		// Note: Your child class can implement multiple interfaces, but only extend one
		// class.

		// Should say meow and woof in that order :)
		// Note: This is a Java lambda expression, shorthand for a for-each loop in this
		// case
		animals.stream().forEach(a -> a.animalSound());

		// Polymorphism
		// Since Cat and Dog both inherit from Animal
		for (Animal animal : animals) {
			// Animal -> Cat
			if (animal instanceof Cat) {
				Cat cat = ((Cat) animal);

				// Should say "nom, lasagna!"
				cat.eatLasagna();
